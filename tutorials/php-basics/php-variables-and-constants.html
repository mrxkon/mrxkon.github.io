		<p>You can retrieve in your code anything that you have stored in PHP variables & constants. Variables data can be changed and constants are permanent, that's a key difference.</p>
		<p>If you've read the <a href="{{ site.site_url }}/tutorials/php-basics/php-syntax/">PHP Syntax</a> article, you already know that it's always good to name your variables and constants with something that is related to your code. You will easily remember and identify them this way.</p>

		</ul>
		<h3 id="variables">Variables</h3>
		<p>All variables must start with a <code class="language-php">$</code> sign and can contain only letters, numbers and underscores. The first character after the <code class="language-php">$</code> cannot be a number and remember they are case sensitive!</p>
<pre><code class="language-php line-numbers">&lt;?php
// This is correct.
$name = 'Konstantinos';

// This is correct as well.
$_last_name_ = 'Xenos';

// This is also correct!
$_middlename123 = 'debugger';

// This is not correct.
$66_route = 'get your kicks';

// This is also not correct.
$current age = 36;
</code></pre>
		<p>You can declare new values since the data in a variable can be changed, but only the last one will be returned.</p>
		<p>Don't get confused for the time being about the single quotes that are sometimes used to wrap the contents of a variable. You will be able to read about <a href="{{ site.site_url }}/tutorials/php-basics/php-data-types/">data types</a>, <a href="{{ site.site_url }}/tutorials/php-basics/php-type-casting/">type casting</a> and <a href="{{ site.site_url }}/tutorials/php-basics/php-strings/">strings</a> in future tutorials.</p>
<pre><code class="language-php line-numbers">&lt;?php
// First declaration.
$myvar = 'first';

// Second declaration.
$myvar = 'second';

# This would output "second" as that's
# the last value that was declared.
echo $myvar;</code></pre>
		<p>Variables can have 3 scopes. They can be global, local and static. Let's see some examples in code!</p>
<pre><code class="language-php line-numbers">&lt;?php
/**
 * Variables declared in the general area of your code
 * are global.
 *
 * As an example here the $name can be parsed directly,
 * but have to be accessed from a function either by adding
 * "global" in front of it, or by the "$GLOBALS" PHP array.
 */

$name = 'xkon';
$site = 'xkon.gr';

// This would output "xkon".
echo $name;

// This would output "xkon xkon.gr" as well.
function information() {
	global $name;

	echo $name . ' ' . $GLOBALS['site'];
}

information();

// This would be wrong though as the variable is global.
function wrong() {
	echo $name;
}

wrong();</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-php line-numbers">&lt;?php
/**
 * Variables declared in functions have a local scope.
 *
 * You will not be able to parse them outside
 * of the function.
 *
 * Since the variable is local, think of it as if it
 * is gettingremoved by the memory and re-declared
 * each time you are running the function.
 */

function mambo() {
	$number = '5';

	echo $number;
}

// This would output "5"
mambo();

// This would output "5" again.
mambo();

// But this wouldn't work.
echo $number;</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-php line-numbers">&lt;?php
/**
 * As seen on the previous example since
 * a variable declared inside a function
 * is getting "reset" each time we run the
 * function we also have the "static" variables.
 *
 * To declare them as static simply write "static"
 * infront of the variable.
 *
 * This way they are not getting reset and you
 * can dynamically alter them.
 *
 * Essentially on this example each time you run
 * mambo(), the variable will always be +3 of its
 * last value.
 */

function mambo() {
	static $number = '2';

	echo $number . '<br>';

	$number = $number + 3;
}

/**
 * This would output "2" as the echo
 * is before the + 3.
 */
mambo();

/**
 * But this would output "5" as we run
 * the function again and the variable
 * was updated.
 */
mambo();</code></pre>
		<h3 id="superglobal-variables">Superglobal Variables</h3>
		<p>Since we covered the variables let's also make a really brief mention at the superglobal variables. I'm mentioning this as I've already shown you one of them that is <code class="language-php">$GLOBALS</code>.</p>
		<ul aria-label="List of PHP Global Variables">
			<li><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.globals.php" target="_blank">$GLOBALS</a>.</li>

		<h3 id="constants">Constants</h3>
		<p>Constants are a bit easier to understand and remember. They are always of global scope even if you declare them inside a function and they are case insensitive. It's better to be consistent as I've mentioned so you should declare constants with uppercase letters.</p>
		<p>The naming convention is similar to the variables with the difference that <code class="language-php">$</code> is not used. To declare a constant you need to use a PHP statement instead called <code class="language-php">define()</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-php line-numbers">&lt;?php
// Declaring a constant.
define( 'FIRST_CONSTANT', 'first' );

// This would output "first".
echo FIRST_CONSTANT;

/**
 * Declaring a constant is global
 * so it can be used anywhere without
 * the need of "global" or "$GLOBALS".
 */
define( 'SECOND_CONSTANT', 'second' );

function second() {
	echo SECOND_CONSTANT;
}

// This would output "second".
second();

/**
 * Even though the constant is defined inside
 * the function. When this function is run
 * the constant becomes global from that point
 * on.
 */
function third() {
	define( 'THIRD_CONSTANT', 3 );
}

third();

// This would output "3".
echo THIRD_CONSTANT;

/**
 * Since constants are permanent and can't
 * be changed. This would produce a notice
 * as it is wrong.
 *
 * The output would always return "yellow"
 * as that's the first declaration that
 * the constant had in the code.
 */
define( 'COLOR', 'yellow' );

define( 'COLOR', 'blue' );

// This would output "yellow".
echo COLOR;</code></pre>
		<p>In WordPress you will find some constants in your <strong>wp-config.php</strong> such as the database credentials since their values should be the same always when used in future code references.</p>
		<h3>Extra Tips on PHP Variables & Constants</h3>
		<p>You should not use the <code class="language-php">$this</code> variable on "general" code as it is a pseudo-variable. You can only use it to refer to an object of a method. I'll explain more about <code class="language-php">$this</code> in the future in the <strong>PHP Advanced</strong> tutorial as it will cover <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming" target="_blank">Object-Oriented Programming</a> (OOP) in PHP.</p>
