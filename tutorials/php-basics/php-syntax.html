		<p>PHP is what I like to call "talkative". If you pay attention to its syntax it is really easy to understand and follow. We call syntax the structure of statements in a computer language.</p>
		<p>You can easily identify PHP code as it must live within the <code class="language-php">&lt;?php</code> and <code class="language-php ">?></code> (opening and closing tags) as well as written in a <strong>.php</strong> file.</p>
		<p>On the following statement example, our code is written in <code class="language-php ">&lt;?php</code> and it should echo (output) a string. The <code class="language-php ">;</code> at the end terminates this statement and since we are only using PHP we can omit the <code>?></code> closing tag as thereâ€™s no other language following.</p>
		<p>I have to mention now just for general knowledge that PHP syntax is <strong>semi case sensitive</strong>. This means that on some occasions it cares about being case sensitive and on some others it does not. For example statements like <strong>if</strong>, <strong>while</strong>, <strong>for</strong> & <strong>functions</strong>, as well as <strong>classes</strong>, are <strong>case insensitive</strong> while <a href="{{ site.site_url }}/tutorials/php-basics/php-variables-and-constants/">variables</a> are <strong>case sensitive</strong>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-php line-numbers">&lt;?php
echo 'Welcome to the PHP Basics tutorial!';

// This would output "PHPBasics".
echo 'PHP';
eChO 'Basics';

// But this would output just "PHP".
$say    = 'PHP';
$basics = 'Basics';

echo $say . $bAsIcS;</code></pre>
	<p>Even though some aspects of the language are case insensitive it is good practice to use standards in your code. Try to have consistency i.e. for <a href="{{ site.site_url }}/tutorials/php-basics/php-variables-and-constants/">variables</a> use lowercase letters and capitalize your classes. This consistency will help you as well as the code will be easier to be read by others.</p>
	<h3>Comments in PHP Syntax</h3>
	<p>I've always been a fan of spacious and well-commented code. It helps to easily remember why it was written and what its purpose is.</p>
	<p>I'm not going to debate "tabs" vs "spaces". I personally use tabs, but that's up to you. What I will strongly advise is adding an empty line when it's needed and write comments as much as possible. This gives your code a more human-readable form.</p>
	<p>Let's see the types of comments that you can use!</p>
	<p>For single lines, you can use either <code class="language-php">//</code> or <code class="language-php">#</code> at the start of each line and for multi-line comments as well as "commenting out" parts of code you can start with <code class="language-php">/*</code> and end with <code class="language-php">*/</code>.</p>
<pre class="language-php line-numbers"><code>&lt;?php
// This is a single line comment.

# This is a single line comment as well!

/*
	This is an example of
	a multi-line comment.
*/

/**
 * This is what we call
 * a "block comment".
 */

// This will output "15" as the "+ 2" has been commented out.
$mystring = 10 /* + 2 */ + 5;

echo $mystring;
</code></pre>
