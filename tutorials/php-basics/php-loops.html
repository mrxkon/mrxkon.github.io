		<p>PHP Loops are used to run a block of code until a condition is met. You can use them as simple count mechanisms, or to loop through data.</p>

		</ul>
		<h3 id="for">For</h3>
		<p>I'd say that the <code class="language-php">for</code> loop is one of the weirdest to use. But if you can understand it's basic it becomes really easy.</p>
		<p>You have to use three expressions here as a starting point, an ending point and in the middle the conditional that you are checking with.</p>
		<p>Note that the starting & conditional are ending with an <code class="language-php">;</code> character but the ending does not.</p>
		<p>The <code class="language-php">for</code> loop syntax. <code class="language-php">for ( starting; conditional; ending ) { do_something }</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-php line-numbers">&lt;?php
/**
 * We say that $i starts with 1.
 *
 * For each time it is less than 6.
 *
 * It should become +1 and run the code.
 *
 * This would output:
 * 1
 * 2
 * 3
 * 4
 * 5
 */

for ( $i = 1; $i &lt; 6; $i++ ) {
	echo $i . '&lt;br>';
}</code></pre>
		<p>Each of the three expressions can be either empty or have multiple expressions as well that you can separate with a comma.</p>
<pre><code class="language-php line-numbers">&lt;?php
/**
 * We start with $y 20 & $z 30.
 *
 * For each time $y is less than
 * or equal to $z.
 *
 * Add 1 to $y and subtract 1 from $z.
 *
 * This would output:
 * $y 20 / $z 30
 * $y 21 / $z 29
 * $y 22 / $z 28
 * $y 23 / $z 27
 * $y 24 / $z 26
 * $y 25 / $z 25
 */

for ( $y = 20, $z = 30; $y <= $z; $y++, $z-- ) {
	echo '$y ' . $y . ' / $z ' . $z . '<br>';
}</code></pre>
		<p>For loops can also be nested to create more complex routines.</p>
<pre><code class="language-php line-numbers">&lt;?php
/**
 * These nested for loops
 * would ouput a 10x10 square.
 */

echo '&lt;div style="line-height:0.5">';

for ( $y = 0; $y &lt; 10; $y++ ) {
	for ( $x = 0; $x &lt; 10; $x++ ) {
		echo '*';
	}

	echo '&lt;br>';
}

echo '&lt;/div>';</code></pre>
		<h3 id="foreach">Foreach</h3>
		<p>The <code class="language-php">foreach</code> loop, as mentioned previously, can be used to loop through arrays. You can use it for any type of array, indexed, associative and multidimensional as well.
		<p>The <code class="language-php">foreach</code> loop syntax. <code class="language-php">foreach ( $array as $key => $value ) { do_something }</code></p>
		<p>Let's start with an indexed array, on this occasion we can omit the <code class="language-php">$key</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-php line-numbers">&lt;?php
// Let's create an array.
$books = array(
	'book 1',
	'book 2',
	'book 3',
);

/**
 * Now we can loop through it.
 *
 * This would output:
 * book 1
 * book 2
 * book 3
 */
foreach ( $books as $book ) {
	echo $book . '&lt;br>';
}</code></pre>
		<p>Let's see an associative array and how we could now use the <code class="language-php">$key</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-php line-numbers">&lt;?php
// Let's create an array.
$books = array(
	'author 1' => 'book 1',
	'author 2' => 'book 2',
	'author 3' => 'book 3',
);

/**
 * Now we can loop through it.
 *
 * This would output:
 * Book 'book 1' by author 1
 * Book 'book 2' by author 2
 * Book 'book 3' by author 3
 */
foreach ( $books as $author => $book ) {
	echo "Book '{$book}' by {$author} &lt;br>";
}</code></pre>
		<p>The multidimensional arrays will need nested foreach loops, similar to what we did with the <code class="language-php">for</code> loop earlier.</p>
<pre><code class="language-php line-numbers">&lt;?php
// Let's create an array.
$books = array(
	'book_1' => array(
		'Name'    => 'the book 1',
		'Author'  => 'an author',
		'Credits' => array(
			'first'  => 'one',
			'second' => 'two',
			'third'  => 'three',
		),
		'Year'    => '2019',
	),
	'book_2' => array(
		'Name'    => 'the book 2',
		'Author'  => 'another author',
		'Credits' => array(
			'first'  => 'one',
			'second' => 'two',
			'third'  => 'three',
		),
		'Year'    => '2020',
	),
);

/**
 * Now we can loop through it.
 *
 * This would output:
 * Name: the book 1
 * Author: an author
 * Credits: one, two, three
 * Year: 2019
 *
 * Name: the book 2
 * Author: another author
 * Credits: one, two, three
 * Year: 2020
 */
foreach ( $books as $book => $information ) {
	foreach ( $information as $info => $details ) {
		if ( ! is_array( $details ) ) {
			echo $info . ': ' . $details . '&lt;br>';
		} elseif ( is_array( $details ) ) {
			echo $info . ': ' . implode( ', ', $details ) . '&lt;br>';
		}
	}
	echo '&lt;br>';
}</code></pre>
		<h3 id="while-do-while">While & Do-While</h3>
		<p>These two loops are very similar. Their only difference is that the <code class="language-php">while</code> loop will not execute the block of code at all is the condition is already met. The <code class="language-php">do-while</code> loop, on the other hand, will have to execute the code at least one time.</p>
		<p>Let's see some examples so you can understand their difference.</p>
		<p>The <code class="language-php">while</code> loop syntax. <code class="language-php">while ( $var &lt; $value ) { do_something }</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-php line-numbers">&lt;?php
/**
 * A "while" loop.
 *
 * This would output:
 * Counting: 1
 * Counting: 2
 * Counting: 3
 * Counting: 4
 * Counting: 5
 */
$count = 1;

while ( $count &lt;= 5 ) {
	echo 'Counting: ' . $count . '&lt;br>';
	$count++;
}</code></pre>

		<p>The <code class="language-php">do-while</code> syntax. <code class="language-php">do { do_something } while ( $var &lt; $value );</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-php line-numbers">&lt;?php
/**
 * A similar "do-while" loop.
 *
 * This would output:
 * Counting: 1
 * Counting: 2
 * Counting: 3
 * Counting: 4
 * Counting: 5
 */

$count = 1;

do {
	echo 'Counting: ' . $count . '&lt;br>';
	$count++;
} while ( $count &lt;= 5 );</code></pre>
		<p>To easily understand the difference now let's use the same example.</p>
<pre><code class="language-php line-numbers">&lt;?php
/**
 * $count is 0.
 *
 * The while loop exits
 * from the start so
 * it will not output anything.
 *
 */
$count = 0;

while ( $count > 0 ) {
	echo 'Counting: ' . $count . '&lt;br>';
}

/**
 * $count is 0.
 *
 * On the "do-while" though
 * the code block runs first
 * and then the check.
 *
 * This would output:
 * Counting: 0
 */

$count = 0;

do {
	echo 'Counting: ' . $count . '&lt;br>';
} while ( $count > 0 );</code></pre>
		<h3>Extra Tips on PHP Loops</h3>
		<p>Instead of always using random variables like <code class="language-php">$i</code>, <code class="language-php">$x</code> etc on <code class="language-php">for</code> & <code class="language-php">while</code> loops, it is better to use variable names that will make sense in your code. Unless they are not important at all to remember.</p>
