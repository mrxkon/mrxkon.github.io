Eighty percent (or more) of the time, when you want to output something it will be by using PHP strings. Let's see how that works!

If you saw the examples on the [PHP Variables & Constants]({{ site.site_url }}/php-basics/php-variables-and-constants), most of them are strings.

You might now think “OK and what's so important I'll just put my word inside quotes ta-da!”.

Sure that's the basic type of string, but there's more to it on how you are using them and with what types of quotes!

When declaring strings you have four choices. Single quoted, double quoted and doc [syntax]({{ site.site_url }}/php-basics/php-syntax) (nowdoc & heredoc).

Let's see them one by one so you can understand the differences. Trust me it's going to make sense at the end and help you a lot.
